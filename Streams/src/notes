Stream into:
	Its a functional process approach to process collections(List , Set , Map etc)
	Good when dealing with large data set
	Lazy evaluation:
		The operation will be executed only when a terminal operation is applied
	parallel processing:
		Can be easily parallelized with parallelStream()
		
		
intermediate/Lazy operations(Transform Data)| It will return a stream itself
	map(x->x*2)
	filter(x->x>10)
	sorted()
	distinct()
	limit(n)
	skip(n)
